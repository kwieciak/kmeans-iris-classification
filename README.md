# KMeans Iris Classification 

## About The Project
This project is an implementation of the K-Means algorithm from scratch. The algorithm is applied to the Iris dataset, a popular dataset in machine learning and statistics. Each entry in the dataset represents an iris flower, including its species and dimensions of its botanical parts, sepal and petal, in centimeters.

## Features
* K-Means algorithm implemented from scratch.
* The project includes a visualization of the results using matplotlib.

## Built With
* Python
* Matplotlib
* Numpy
* Pandas

## Getting started
